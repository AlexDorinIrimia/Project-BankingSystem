To run the application, you need to download SQLite in order to use the database. (For download: https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)

How to Use

When running the program, a list of options will be displayed that you can choose from. To select an option, enter the number displayed before the option using the keyboard.
Depending on the chosen option, there are 3 cases:
  1. Customer Registration - you will need to enter the required information.
  2. Login - you will need to enter the required information (name and password); if there is no account associated with the respective customer, you will be asked if you want to create an account (response options are provided in parentheses and must be entered exactly as they appear).
  3. Exit - the program will terminate its execution.
